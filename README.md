# Hangman Game

Welcome to the classic word-guessing game, Hangman! This Python-based Hangman game will challenge your vocabulary and guessing skills. Try to guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

3. Run the game by executing the following command:

   ```python hangman.py```

4. You'll be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters in the word to guess, along with the number of incorrect guesses allowed.

5. Enter a letter to make a guess. Make sure it's a single letter (A-Z) and not a number or symbol.

6. If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. If it's wrong, your incorrect guess count will increase, and the hangman drawing will progress.

7. Continue guessing letters until you either successfully guess the word or run out of attempts.

8. After each game, you'll have the option to play again.
